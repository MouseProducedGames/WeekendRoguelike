# Current Status
* As a classic Roguelike, all map objects are represented using text symbols.
  * Please do not resize the console; that may cause the game to crash if it attempts to draw at an invalid position.
* A Dwarf Barbarian player character will be created for you.
  * You are the '@' symbol.
  * Move and attack using the number pad with numlock on.
  * Your stats are at the bottom of the screen.
    * (He)alth: If your character runs out of this, they die.
    * (St)rength: How much damage you do, and how well you resist damage.
    * (Ag)ility: How well you dodge.
    * (Co)ordination: How accurately you hit.
* There is one zombie on the map.
  * The zombie is the 'z' symbol.
  * The zombie moves randomly; if it moves into your square, it will attack.
* The map is 80x25 (width x length).
  * There are invisible walls at the edges of the map.
