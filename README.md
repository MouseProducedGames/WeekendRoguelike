# WeekendRoguelike
A free- and open-source Roguelike in the classic style done as a casual, weekend/free time project. Sometimes it receives more work if I have insomnia.

WeekendRoguelike is data-driven, and the game can be modded by editing the text files in the Data folder. Currently, modding capability is limited, as the engine itself is limited.
